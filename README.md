<h1>Beagle Bone Black IO Library</h1>
<h2>An object oriented C++ library to help with general IO access</h2>

To clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/dmbonsall/BeagleBoneBlackIOLib.git`

This library to to allow for easy object oriented access to the Beagle Bone Black's general purpose IO in the default startup configuration. It is intended to provide a wrapper around the file IO that is required to do things like read an ADC value, or just toggle the state of a GPIO pin. This is definitely a work in progress, and at this point is intended to be a simple library to get up and running quickly with the most basic BBB IO functionality and to provide an example of one way to access the BBB's hardware.
